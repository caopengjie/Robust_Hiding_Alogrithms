# UERD
My personal implementation of UERD(Uniform Embedding Revisited).<br>
The paper is: Guo, L., Ni, J., Su, W., Tang, C., \& Shi, Y. Q. (2015). Using statistical image model for jpeg steganography: uniform embedding revisited. IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics \& Security, 10(12), 2669-2680.<br>

The following resources can be found at http://dde.binghamton.edu/download/:<br>
The JPEG I/O mex files are from Phil Sallee's JPEG Toolbox.<br>
The optimal embedding simulator is DDE's implementation.(Digital Data Embedding Laboratory, SUNY Binghamton).<br>
The demo JPG image is in BOSSbase 1.01.<br>

Have fun! :)
